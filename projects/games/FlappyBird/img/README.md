# Game Images Directory

This directory is for game images, but the game is now configured to use procedurally generated placeholder images by default.

If you want to use custom images, create these files:
- background.png - Large panoramic background image (recommended size: 8400x2000)
- ground.png - Repeatable ground texture
- pipe-top.png - Top pipe image
- pipe-bottom.png - Bottom pipe image
- bird.png - Bird sprite sheet with 3 animation frames

Then use the debug menu to toggle between real and placeholder images.

## Using Placeholders vs. Real Images

The game uses placeholders by default for consistent visuals, but you can toggle between placeholder and real images using the debug panel (click the "Debug" button in the bottom-right corner).

## About the Background Image

The game supports a large scrolling background image that moves as the bird progresses. If using a real background image, the recommended size is around 8400x2000 pixels to allow for extended scrolling.
